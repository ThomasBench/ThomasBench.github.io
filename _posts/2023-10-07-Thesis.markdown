Climate change information impacts public understanding and impacts actions to address
climate change. We study information campaigns in climate change discussions on Online
Social Networks. We use an information theory based metric, Transfer Entropy, to unveil
the actors involved, and describe their behavior. We also highlight Large Language
Models capabilities and limitations in generating climate-related content. We describe the
behavior of information campaigns through simultaneous activity captured by Transfer
Entropy. Moreover, we show that Transfer Entropy helps unveil actors involved in
such campaigns. Finally, we observe that with the rise of LLMs as content generators,
producing content as credible as human-made articles could still be challenging, and that
the generation capabilities are biased across the climate change discussion.
