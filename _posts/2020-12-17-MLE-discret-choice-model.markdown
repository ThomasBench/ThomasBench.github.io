Discrete Choice Models (DCMs) aim to understand and model choices of individuals among a finite and discrete set of alternatives. Such models are mainly used by forecasters and policymakers to study consumer demand (e.g for transport mode choice). DCMs are based on Utility theory, which introduces the so-called utility functions designed to represent the preference structure of individuals among a given choice set.  
  
Specifications in DCMs are often introduced according to intuition, judgment and prior behavioral assumptions of the modeller. Therefore, utility specification represents a difficult task that one could see as a variable selection problem.
In this report, we investigate an automatized approach by introducing a regularization term in the likelihood function, aiming to push towards zero the parameters associated with the least relevant explanatory variables. Finally, the most penalized variables are discarded from the model with the expectation of not loosing too much information.
