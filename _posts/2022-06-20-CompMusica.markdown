This is a project carried out for the [Computer and Music](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/computers-and-music-COM-418) course at EPFL by [Pr. West](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZiFn598AAAAJ).

Made in collaboration with [Eliott Zemour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliott-zemour/), [Matheus Bernat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-bernat/), and [Benjamin Hansson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-hansson-39b391140/).

We human beings have a great power of creativity,
and machines have a great power of extracting hidden patterns
and replicating them, so why not join these two powers? In this
project we aim to help uninspired songwriters who have the
perfect lyrics but want a chord progression that goes well with
the lyrics. To do this, we constructed a dataset of English songs
with nearly 30 thousand songs from Ultimate Guitar, perform
chord and lyrics analyses on it, and then construct a recurrent
neural network (RNN) that takes in lyrics and outputs a 4-long
chord progression. As the main results of this project, we have
the dataset whose features can be further explored, and a Jupyter
notebook with the RNN that takes in lyrics and outputs the 4-long
chord progression.
