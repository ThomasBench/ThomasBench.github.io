This is a project carried out for the CS-433 Machine Learning course at EPFL, based on the well known Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge which uses simulated data with features characterizing events detected by ATLAS ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/)).  

The project was done in teams of 3, as a result we reached a score of 81.1% on our last submission. The approach used was regularized gradient descent with a logistic loss function for classification.  
During the challenge, we performed a rigorous data preprocessing and got familiar with overflow problems in the numerical evaluation of logistic loss functions.
