Using newspapers issued during the Second industrial revolution, this study aims to quantify
the anxiety of the people in four different languages: French, English, German, and Spanish. By
performing word ratio for OCR assessment, the quality of each newspaper was assessed and robustly
compared to the others. Then, using state-of-the-art Transformers models for date detection, it
assesses the performance of these models on noisy text datasets in French and English, and use
them to perform date detection on the French newspaper Le Figaro. From it, this study tries to tie
together the number of dates expressed in a newspaper to the anxiety of the population at that time.
